Added in hop infuser thing directly to keg immediately after flameout (pause function in zymatic advanced editor). \\n\\nMeasured original gravity at that point using refractometer. It was 1.059, 0.03 short of the 1.062 I was aiming for. Possibly because I used fewer rice hulls than previous recipes? However,  1.059 was exactly what picobrew recipe editor predicted.\\n\\nWhirlpool was set to 45 minutes @ 185\\u00b0F. Took about 15 minutes to get down to temp, at which point the step started. The hop cylinder was tied to dental floss for fetching. Pulled vigorously on this every few minutes to try to ensure hops were being adequately mixed in wort. At the end of the brew when I removed the cylinder I squeeze all the juicy green hoppey goodness out of out. Still not convince the device allows for much circulation of the hops in the wort/beer.\\n\\nPut the corny in the fermentation freezer to chill down from brew temp (around 140\\u00b0 F). Pitched yeast later that day, around 4pm, with temp reading 68\\u00b0 F. Fermentation bubbles started to appear by that evening and vigorous fermentation seemed to be happening by the next day. Dry hopped with 56g (2oz) Mosaic that afternoon (approximately 24h after pitching) to hopefully get biotransformation and also oxygen scrubbing by the fermentation (reduce chances of oxydation). Dry hopping was again in the cylinder, attached via dental floss.\",\"brew_id\":55,\"created_at\":\"2018-08-04T17:43:52Z\"}],\"brew\":{\"id\":55,\"name\":\"Mosaic New England IPA\",\"created_at\":\"2018-08-04T17:06:56Z\",\"efficiency\":53,\"batch_size_litres\":\"9.46353\",\"batch_size_gallons\":\"2.5\",\"boil_loss_litres\":\"1.51416\",\"boil_loss_gallons\":\"0.4\",\"target_mash_temp_c\":\"68.88889\",\"target_mash_temp_f\":\"156.0\",\"water_grain_ratio_metric\":\"3.70119\",\"water_grain_ratio_us\":\"1.774\",\"brew_date\":null,\"recorded_original_gravity\":1.059,\"recorded_final_gravity\":1.019,\"recorded_post_boil_volume_litres\":null,\"recorded_post_boil_volume_gallons\":null,\"grain_temp_c\":\"23.33333\",\"grain_temp_f\":\"74.0\",\"style_id\":49,\"user_id\":1,\"fermentable_addition_ids\":[211,212,213,214,215],\"hop_addition_ids\":[329,330],\"yeast_addition_ids\":[34],\"note_ids\":[75]}}"
